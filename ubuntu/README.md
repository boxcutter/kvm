You'll find two different flavours of templates here:

- `cloud` - based on Ubuntu cloud images
- `iso` - based on Ubuntu boot ISOs

In general, use the cloud-based templates as they are more robust and likely not to need
many changes over time to get them to work. The ISO-based templates are for legacy
setups that aren't adequately covered by the cloud images and for protyping metal
machine-based autoinstalls, not really for making reusable vm templates.
